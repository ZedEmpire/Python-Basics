        "Q3. What are pre-defined keywords in Python ?\n",
        "\n",
        "    - Predefined keywords in Python are words with special meanings that are part of the Python syntax. They cannot be changed and cannot be used as identifiers like variable or function names.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q4. Can keywords be used as variable names\n",

        "    - Conditional statements in Python are used to control the flow of execution based on certain conditions. They allow the program to make decisions and execute specific blocks of code depending on whether a condition is True or False. This makes programs dynamic and able to react to different inputs, situations, or states.\n",
